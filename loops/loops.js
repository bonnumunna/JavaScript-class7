/*
    ================== LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT ===============
    Repettition of processes is achieved in programming with the help of loops.
    Generally, we have:
    1. While loop
    2. Do...While loop
    2. For loop.
    
    There are other advancement to the for loop which we may look into later.

    Loops will normally have conditions which must be true for the process(es) captured insided them to run. There must also be some way to keep track of iterations and change values so the loop condition eventually becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise, we would have an infinite (never ending) loop.

// While Loop.

/*
const setValue = 10;
var currentValue = 1;
while (currentValue <= setValue) {
    console.log(currentValue); // Print the current value

    // currentValue = currentValue + 1;
    // currentValue += 1
    currentValue++; // Increment current value by 1
} // This loop will print from 1 to 10
*/

// Write a While loop that prints from 20 to 15
